Task-Manager

Tech Stacks used: React,Tailwind CSS,Node JS,Express JS,Mongo DB

This is a task management webpage where users can create, update, and delete tasks. The webpage is fully responsive. I implemented form validation on the frontend to handle user input errors. For API integration, I used the Axios package. To enhance user experience, I added toast messages to display success notifications for task creation, updation, and deletions. The application is deployed on Vercel.
